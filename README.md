# AlgeCheck-app
Algebra calculator app for 6th form project

The idea behind this app is for students who are doing algebra homework to have a quick calculator that will help them check thier work.
The app allows them to check quadratic equations and long division. 

Version 1 was coded in with tkinter.

Version 2 is a recent remake which was created using kivy.
